`moai status` shows issues with no epic, reviews stalled for days, and how

  moai add 'body from stdin' -b -
  moai add 'to someone else' -a 'Kim (kim@example.com)'   else the creator
  moai add 'with no owner' -a none

Title and body go separately. The title is one line saying what is wrong -
the board, `ready` and the explorer list show the title only. Do not push a
long text into the title; split it into the body. The body is markdown and
`-b -` reads it from stdin:

moai add 'the parser dies on a BOM' -t bug -b - <<'BODY'
- what is wrong: it reads the three leading bytes as the title
- where to fix: the read in src/store.rs

moai add --from - <<'PLAN'

- recover a truncated line

  Column names and their order come from statuses in .moai/config.toml

  Skipping ahead and going back are both allowed. This tool has no approval.

  moai mv moai-4aex in_progress
  moai mv moai-4aex moai-9k2p done

  looks again inside the lock and moves only if it is still that column - the
  loser gets one stderr line and a non-zero code. **Give one id** then:
  with several, the won and the lost rows share one exit code.

  moai mv moai-4aex in_progress --from todo

  Work that is someone else's, or nobody's, is asked about before it is picked
  up. Moving it into a started column still goes through - one stderr line says
  whose it is. On a yes, `--take` makes you the assignee in the same write and
  leaves a note `Taken-over: <who it was|none>`; `-m` says who said yes. It also
  takes a row that already stands in that column. `--json` carries taken
  (rows whose assignee changed) and theirs (moved without --take), always as
  arrays.

  moai mv moai-4aex in_progress --from todo --take -m 'the owner said yes'

  Closing says what that write opened - work that just became ready, a parent

  h and the left arrow fold it. On an unfolded member row, h folds its parent
  and lands on the parent; with nothing to fold it leaves one level. On a
  project header row, l and the right arrow unfold and h and the left arrow
  fold. Tab unfolds everything under it recursively and folds it again on a
  second press. Unfolded members stand with branch marks in the title column,
  and that unfolding is not kept in the config. gg and Home go to the top,
  G and End to the bottom. Ctrl-d and Ctrl-u scroll half a page, Ctrl-f and
  Ctrl-b (PageDown and PageUp) a whole page and the wheel three rows — the
  list, not the cursor: the chosen row and the detail stay put even once the
  row is off screen, and the next cursor key moves from that row and scrolls
  back to it.
  Ctrl-w w moves the focus between the list and the detail (Ctrl-w W goes the
  other way; Ctrl-w h and Ctrl-w l pick the left and right pane, Ctrl-w k and
  Ctrl-w j the top and bottom one when the detail is split that way), and every
  movement key moves the focused pane — to scroll the detail, go there with
  Ctrl-w w.
  / searches, Esc clears the filter you set. r marks the row under the cursor
  as read (see [NEW] below).
  The search and filter fields take Enter to apply and Esc to give up, the
  search filters the list as you type, and Tab and Shift-Tab pick where it
  looks: everything, id, title, tag, body or note (everything reads the
  notes too). In the filter field, Tab completes key names and values,
  Shift-Tab cycles backwards, and another key keeps the current candidate;
  a unique key gains an equals sign so its value can be typed straight away.
  The filter field lists the keys it takes and a few examples
  above itself, and with the cursor in the value of assignee=, tag=, no-tag=
  or milestone= it lists the values there instead: typing narrows them, Up
  and Down pick one, and Enter puts it in; with no list standing it applies
  the filter. Fixed fields also complete status names, priority p0 to p3 and
  type names with Tab; these fields keep Enter to apply. The header at the
  top numbers every registered project, and
  pressing that number without SPC jumps straight there — 0 is everything,
  one list of all projects.

  The rest lives in the menu that opens the moment you press SPC. The menu
  stands up only what works where you are, ignores keys it does not know,
  closes on Esc or SPC and goes one level up on Backspace. Keys that move
  the focused pane close the menu and make that move in the same press,
  unless a key on that level holds the letter (SPC g, SPC g l, SPC c h,

             Clicking puts the focus on the pane and the cursor on the row
             under it. The wheel scrolls the pane under the pointer, and
             neither the focus nor a cursor follows: the list, the detail, the
             statistics window, the wiki window's two panes (a click there
             picks the pane and the page, and a click on a link follows it).
             Dragging the line between the list and the detail resizes them,
             and the share the list takes is kept under [tui] as list_width
             and list_height. The wiki window's line drags the same way and
             keeps a share of its own as wiki_width — until it is dragged it
             splits by list_width. With the SPC menu open, a
             click on an item is its key — a group goes down a level, a
             toggle keeps the menu open, and Esc and Bksp on the bottom line
             close it or go up — and a click or a roll outside the menu closes
             it and does what it does there. While a form, a picker or
             a prompt is up the mouse is the terminal's again — selecting and
             middle-button paste work there as they always did. Over the list
             and the detail, the terminal's own selection and paste need Shift
             held in most terminals, Option in iTerm2
  The one key that quits outright is Ctrl-C — anywhere, even mid-typing.
  The screen rereads itself — issues written next door, and `moai read` or
  `moai project add` in another terminal, land without a keypress.

  The version line in the header says whether a newer release is out. When
  one is, the banner says so and names `moai update`, which upgrades the moai
  you are running in place; quitting prints it again. Where `moai update`
  cannot run but install.sh can (a directory under your home you cannot
  write), quitting prints the install.sh line instead, with --dir when it is
  not ~/.local/bin. No line is shown for a build from source, for a binary not
  named moai, or on a machine the releases do not cover.

  Of what came to me (assigned to me or under it), rows changed since the
  last look carry a [NEW] mark in front of the title. Read marks live in my own
  config and the tracker does not change — on the CLI that is `moai read`.

  The list shows done and hides deferred work to begin with — the mark on
  the path line says so, [deferred hidden] or, with the archive below,
  [deferred·archive 312 hidden]. The view is separate from the filter, so
  Esc does not clear it and the two apply together.
  Done that has sat in done for a while is the archive (archive_days in
  .moai/config.toml, 14 unless written; 0 turns it off). It stays hidden on
  the list and the board even with done shown, and the path line counts it
  — [archive 312 hidden]. SPC v o shows it and is kept under [tui] as
  show_archived; SPC v a (all) leaves it hidden. / search finds it anyway.
  Sorting puts urgent, new, earlier column and alphabetical on top. The order
  is a list of fields, like ORDER BY: the next field decides only where the
  ones before it tie. Each lowercase SPC s key makes the order that one field,
  and pressing it again turns it around; an uppercase one adds its field at
  the end, and pressing it again turns that field around. When the order is
  not the default (priority) the path line says which it is, every field with
  ↑ or ↓, as in sort priority↑, updated↓.
  Columns (SPC c) turn on and off with [shown/hidden]. Tag, epic, assignee,
  created and updated dates stand on the right of the row, and when it gets
  narrow they are dropped in that order — dates, then epic, then assignee,
  then tag — to leave room for the title.
  View, sort and columns are written into the [tui] table of the user config
  on every press and carry over to the next run and to other projects (the
  same file `moai project add` writes). The sort is the exception: one picked
  inside a project is kept for that project alone, as order under
  [tui.project.\"<project path>\"], and one picked in 0 is kept as order under
  [tui] — the default for every project without its own. order is a list in
  the words of `moai show --sort` but id, such as
  [\"priority\", \"updated:asc\"], and the older sort and sort_reversed pair
  is still read where order is absent and written beside it from the first
  field, for an older moai.

  SPC s e opens the sort window over the list. All six fields stand in it:
  the ones in the order first, numbered and marked ↑ asc or ↓ desc, then the
  rest marked with a dot. j and k move, J and K move the field down or up the
  order, SPC puts it in at the end or takes it out (the last one stays), and
  d turns its direction. Enter applies the order where you stand and keeps it
  there — inside a project for that project, in 0 as the default. D applies
  it and keeps it as the default, the order under [tui], even inside a
  project; a project that has an order of its own gets this one too. Esc
  leaves without a change.

  SPC g b lays the same rows out as a kanban board instead of a list, and
  SPC g l brings the list back. It is the list's layout, not another window:
  the cursor, the filter, the view, search, [NEW] and the detail are the
  list's, and the choice is kept under [tui] as layout. The menu's root names
  the screen that stands, as in +screen [board]. The columns are backlog,
  deferred and the config's columns in order — backlog is a kind and deferred
  an axis, so nothing is stored for them.
  SPC v b hides backlog items in both the board and the list, and is kept
  under [tui] as hide_backlog.
  At the project root every milestone is a lane, with (no milestone) last;
  inside a milestone or an epic there is one lane. Epics and milestones are
  not cards. Each card is two lines, its id, column and priority over its title,
  and the cursor's card is marked and drawn reversed. Cards Enter can go
  into end their title with /, as in the list. The foot, a third line,
  stands while SPC c has tag, epic, assignee or a date on — an epic shows up on
  the board only as the name in that foot (SPC c e). Cards that are not yours
  grow that foot anyway and say whose they are, dimmed — → name, or unowned —
  in the assignee's place; your own cards stay two lines. Whose is decided the
  way `moai ready` decides it, and when who you are is unknown no card is set
  apart. On a narrow card the tags and the epic name shrink, longest first, so
  whose it is and the dates still show. j and k move within the
  column, h and l go to the next column at the nearest height, gg and G go to
  the column's ends, Enter and Backspace go in and out as in the list, and Tab
  does nothing. The whole board scrolls as one; the column names stay on top.
  When the columns do not fit, the column the cursor stands in always stands
  and the frame title names the rest with their counts. Clicking a card puts
  the cursor on it. The wheel, Ctrl-d and Ctrl-u, Ctrl-f and Ctrl-b, and
  PageDown and PageUp scroll the board, not the cursor: the chosen card and
  the detail stay put even once the card is off screen, and the board scrolls
  to its end. The next cursor key moves from that card and scrolls back to
  it. In the overview (0) every project stands as a header
  across the columns, the same line the list gives it, and an unfolded project
  has its milestone lanes under it; the columns are those of every project
  shown, together. The cursor stands on a header too — k from the project's
  top card in a column goes up to it — and there l unfolds, h folds, Tab
  unfolds everything and Enter goes in, as in the list.

  With registered projects (`moai project add`), 0 lists them all — a header
  row per project with that project's rows under it. Started outside a
  `.moai` it begins there; started inside one it begins in that project.
  Coming out through 0 leaves the project you were in unfolded and the rest
  as header rows only — a project is read the moment it unfolds (its header
  spins while it reads).
  Enter on a header row goes into that project, Backspace only goes up a
  directory. Enter on a group row under it goes into that project and lands
  there — you never drill down in the one list; drilling down always happens
  inside a project.
  View, sort and columns apply to every unfolded project while search and
  filter apply inside one project only — jotting (SPC n) and read (r) go to
  the project of the row under the cursor. With nothing registered and
  started outside, an empty list stands and says to add the first project
  with SPC p a (`--json` gives an empty `projects` array and exits 0).

  SPC p a opens a window to pick a directory and register it as a project —
  it walks in and out one level at a time (Enter and Backspace, moving with
  the same j, k, gg and G as the list), and directories with a `.moai` and those
  already registered are marked. Inside the window, a registers the directory
  under the cursor, `.` shows or hides dotted directories, and g p opens a
  field to type a path (Enter goes, Esc gives up). The window closes on Esc.
  Any subdirectory of a monorepo stands on its own exactly as picked. It is
  taken even without a `.moai`. The window opens inside a project too, so the
  first project can be added with nothing registered.
  On a header row, SPC p d asks once and then only drops it from the list —
  y is yes and any other key gives up. The directory and its `.moai` stay.
  It writes where `moai project add|rm` writes.

  SPC g s opens the statistics window in place of the list and the detail —
  the numbers `moai stats` gives, drawn as bars: the flow per week, the
  columns and priorities, lead and cycle time, and AI work by model. It
  counts the project you are in, or on the one list (0) the project of the
  row under the cursor. With a filter hung (SPC f or /) it counts only what
  passes, and the title says so. b switches the flow between weeks and
  days; j and k, Ctrl-d and Ctrl-u, Ctrl-f and Ctrl-b, gg and G scroll it;
  Esc goes back to where you were, with the cursor, the filter and the
  detail as they were. SPC opens the menu over it with the screens alone:
  SPC g l and SPC g b close it onto the list or the board, and SPC g s
  counts again from scratch — the window is opened fresh every time and
  nothing of it is kept. On a narrow screen it shows the same figures as
  text.

  SPC g w opens the wiki window in place of the list and the detail — the
  project's manual, the markdown pages `moai wiki ls` lists (under docs/
  unless wiki_dir in .moai/config.toml says otherwise). It reads the project
  you are in, or on the one list (0) the project of the row under the
  cursor, and it only reads: pages are files you edit and commit. The pages
  stand on the left, the home page (README or index) first, and the right
  pane shows the page under the cursor. j and k, Ctrl-d and Ctrl-u, Ctrl-f
  and Ctrl-b, gg and G move the focused pane — on the list, Ctrl-d, Ctrl-u,
  Ctrl-f, Ctrl-b and the wheel scroll it and leave the cursor and the page
  where they are, as in the explorer's list. Enter on the list goes to the
  page and Ctrl-w w goes back and forth. Tab picks the links drawn on the
  page in turn, from the first one on screen and round from the last to the
  first, and Shift-Tab goes the other way from the last one on screen: the
  picked link shows reversed, the key bar names where it goes, Enter follows
  it, and once it leaves the pane it is dropped. Clicking a link follows it
  at once. On the page with no link picked, Enter opens
  a list of its links and the issue ids it names, then the pages linking to
  it (marked ←), which moves with j, k, gg, G, Ctrl-d, Ctrl-u, Ctrl-f and
  Ctrl-b, takes one with Enter and closes on Esc. Taking a page link or a
  page linking here goes there and Bksp comes back the way you came. Links
  to a heading (page.md#anchor) open at that heading, its line marked ▸
  until you scroll; one to a heading the page does not have is marked and
  opens the page at its top. Taking an id closes
  the window onto that row (from the one list, inside that project). Links
  that lead nowhere, addresses outside the wiki and ids the tracker does not
  hold are marked and only say so. The page as written (SPC v r) marks no
  link — Tab says so. / searches the titles and bodies of the pages and
  narrows the list as you type, and Esc drops a picked link, then clears
  that search, and then closes the window, with the cursor, the filter and
  the detail as they were. SPC opens the menu over it with the screens and
  SPC v r (raw or rendered). The window is read fresh every time and nothing
  of it is kept.

  SPC n opens the jot form anywhere inside a project. It keeps a backlog item
  with no epic. If an editor is there ($VISUAL, $EDITOR, or vi or nano on
  PATH) it opens like a git commit message: the first line is the title, then
  a blank line, then the body, and comment lines are guidance to be deleted.
  Leave the title empty, or end the editor with an error, and nothing is
  kept. With no editor the built-in form opens — one title line and a body,
  Tab moves between them (Enter in the title goes to the body) and Ctrl-S
  keeps it. Esc closes it, asking once if you had typed something (y throws
  it away). This is the one write to an issue — editing is done on the CLI.
  `--json` prints only that directory's listing, with no screen (outside a
  `.moai`, the rows of the layer).

  `--path` takes an issue id, or one of the two baskets by the word this
  tool uses for them: none (no milestone) and lost.")]

  moai merge-driver --install        install into this repository's .git/config
  moai merge-driver --install --as <path>  install with that command

  **When the installed path disappears, git falls back to its own merge.**
  Git reads a driver that did not run as a conflict while leaving this side's
  file as it is, and with no markers in it whoever runs `git add` throws the
  other side away wholesale. So the installed line makes the driver write
  neither an answer nor markers and merges the failed round again with
  `git merge-file` - markers stand, and the worst case equals an uninstalled
  clone. Even so the path is worth keeping: a fallen-back round loses the
  value of resolving per issue. The default is the absolute path of the
  binary running now, and pointing that at a worktree `target/` kills it with
  that worktree - `--local` is shared by the clone, so every checkout lands in
  that state at once. `--as` also takes a word on PATH, but in this
  repository do not pass a bare `moai`: that is the old moai binary and does
  not know this command.

  One line is one issue and they are sorted by id, so two branches that fixed
  different issues collide just because those lines are neighbours. Here they
  are paired by id and merged three-way per issue. Different fields of the
  same issue are merged too - tags and blocks add what was added and remove
  what was removed.

  **When the same field was changed differently, a person resolves it.**
  Picking one side silently makes the other side's edit vanish without a
  trace. A line this binary cannot read travels through byte for byte - paired
  by its id when it has one, so only a row both sides changed is handed over,
  and counted line by line when it has none. What still hands the whole file
  over inside conflict markers is a duplicated id among readable rows, and a
  file that is not text - keeping only what parsed would lose the rest.

  Installing is once per clone. Git reads the driver command from the config
  only, and the config is not committed. In a clone without it, merge=moai in
  `.gitattributes` is simply ignored and git's own merge runs - merging is
  exactly as it was without it. When that repository does set merge=moai,
  `moai status` says in one line that it is not installed here.

  **To say this repository does not want the driver, write that decision in
  `.gitattributes`.** A line for the snapshot that settles merge itself -
  `.moai/issues.jsonl   text eol=lf -merge` - is read as the decision: `init`
  leaves that line alone and every merge-driver line goes quiet. Deleting the
  line instead is read as a gap, and the next `moai init` writes it back.")]

  use it ($TMUX set for moai-tmux, $CMUX_SURFACE_ID for moai-cmux,
  SAYCODE_AGENT_ENV for moai-saycode); Enter passes the checked ones on to
  `moai skill install --with`, and unchecking one already planted passes
  --without. --with <skill> (repeatable, or names with a comma) checks and
  locks that row and turns installing on; it cannot go with --no-skill.
  Where nothing is asked, only what --with names is planted - nothing by
  what your shell says - and optional skills already planted are refreshed.

  A new prefix is up to 8 characters - you type it with every id. A longer
  one is refused with shorter candidates. Without one it is made from the
  directory name: dropping hyphens if that fits (moa-issue becomes moaissue),
  else the initials of the hyphenated words (my-company-backend becomes mcb),
  and with a single word the first 8 characters. A repository already
  installed with a longer prefix is read and written as it is.

  **It installs the merge driver too.** The repository declares merge=moai in
  `.gitattributes`, and the command that word names lives in .git/config,
  which is not committed - so init writes both. It picks the `moai` on PATH
  when that is the same build, else the binary running now, and says which.
  Run it again and a path that has gone dead is replaced. A clone of a
  repository that already has a .moai never runs init: there the one line
  from `moai status` is what asks for `moai merge-driver --install`.

  --no-driver leaves .git/config alone. A repository that wants no driver at
  all says so in `.gitattributes` - a line for the snapshot that settles
  merge itself (`.moai/issues.jsonl   text eol=lf -merge`) is read as the
  decision and init leaves it alone. An explicit --driver with --tracking
  exclude or gitignore is refused.

  --json reports gitignore=true only when .gitignore was written; exclude=true
  means the ignore lines were written to .git/info/exclude. Its driver is
  planted, current (already the same line), off (the repository declares no
  driver, or is not a git repository), failed (driver_trouble says why),
  skipped (--no-driver, this run only) or untracked (a tracker kept out of
  git - git never merges it, so there is nothing to drive).

  --check writes nothing and only answers whether the AGENTS.md block is
  current, stale or missing, and where the merge driver stands. It is
  non-zero when a file cannot be read or git cannot determine tracking.

  --print only prints that block. That is where to copy it from when the file
  the agent reads is not AGENTS.md - --print and init write the same text.")]

const SHOW_LIST: &str = "  Order: --sort takes fields separated by commas, like ORDER BY - the next
  field decides only where the ones before it tie. The fields: priority
  (the default: urgent first), created and updated (newest first), status
  (the column order of .moai/config.toml), assignee (the name the screen
  shows, unowned last), title (ignoring case), id. A field without a
  direction keeps the one named here; :asc puts the smaller value first
  (p0, the oldest, the first column, A) and :desc the larger - unowned
  rows go first under assignee:desc. A field is given once. When every
  field ties, a last field of created or updated falls to id alone, and
  any other to priority, then id. --reverse turns the whole order around,
  ties included.

    moai show --sort priority,updated:desc
    moai show --sort status:asc,title

  Paging: -n cuts the list, and --after <id> starts the next page after the
  last id of the page before. The cursor is that row's values in the order,
  not a position, so rows created or removed meanwhile never shift a page.
  A row whose place in the order changes between pages - the cursor row or
  any other, a priority edit included - can repeat or be skipped; id,
  created and lists of those two alone are the orders no edit moves.
  Lines sharing one id
  (twins a merge left behind) stand together and a page never splits them,
  so such a page can run past -n. --json stays an array - fewer rows than
  -n means the list has ended.

    moai show --sort id -n 100 --json
    moai show --sort id -n 100 --after <last id> --json

  Archive: a row that has stood in done for archive_days (14 unless
  .moai/config.toml says otherwise, 0 turns it off) is the archive - an
  epic or milestone counted from when it got to done, the clock --done
  reads. --all and -s done leave it out and the tail says how many;
  --archived brings it back, done and deferred with it. Asking by time
  (--since, --created, --done, --stale) finds it anyway, and so does -g
  once done is let in (-g --all). Nothing is stored: it is read from the
  column and the clock each time.

    moai show --archived -g parser

  Time: --since <when> keeps the rows whose own updated_at is at or after
  it. --created and --done take a range from..to or from~to with either
  side left open, or a single time, which is all it spans. <when> is
  YYYY-MM-DD, a day on your own clock - the time zone the screen and
  milestone deadlines use; YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, one minute on that clock;
  or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ, an instant in UTC that no time zone moves. The
  end of a range takes all it spans too, so ~2026-10-05 23:59 runs to
  23:59:59. Quote a range that opens with ~ ('~2026-10-05'): zsh takes a
  bare ~2026-10-05 for a named directory. --done looks at rows standing in
  done now, at the time they last got there - an epic or milestone when its
  last member got to done, or when the rest were deferred if that came
  later. Moving rows in or out and removing them leave no trace on the
  group: closed that way it counts from its last finished member, and a
  deferred row moved into a closed group dates it from that row's deferral.
  Asking by time opens what the list hides by default - done, deferred and
  backlog items - because a row closed meanwhile changed too. Narrow with
  -s (name the columns you want) or --type; --deferred keeps only what is
  deferred, and no flag leaves deferred rows out. A lone instant given to
  --created or --done is that one second, not a day.

  --filter takes each filter as item=value, one per flag, and adds four
  time items named after the --json fields: created_at, updated_at,
  started_at and done_at. Each reads the row's own field - a group's too,
  never its members' - in the forms above, and a row without that field
  is unknown and falls in no range. done_at stays when a row is reopened,
  so add status=done for what is closed now; done= keeps the meaning of
  --done. updated_at= with a single day is that day, where since= runs on
  from it. In the explorer (SPC f) a value right after = may be quoted.

    moai show --filter 'done_at=2026-10-03 00:00~2026-10-05 23:59'
    moai show -a raven -a joshep --filter started_at=2026-10-01~

  --since keys on each row's own stamp. It misses a removed row (`moai rm`
  leaves no row - --removed below gives those), a note (`moai note` writes
  the journal, not the row), a row whose derived value changed without a
  write of its own (a group's column, an inherited epic) and a row merged
  in with an older stamp. A stamp moai cannot read (fractions, an offset)
  falls in no time range. For a complete copy, pull the whole list
  (--archived, and `moai backlog show --archived` for backlog items)
  and compare row by row.

    moai show --since 2026-09-29T00:00:00Z --json
    moai show --done 2026-09-01..2026-09-30 --type issue

  Removed: `moai show --removed` lists the issues `moai rm` took out,
  oldest first, read from the journal beside the tracker - other
  worktrees are not overlaid, `rm --line` removed an unreadable line, not
  an issue, and `moai <kind> show` refuses it. With --since, those whose
  rm line is stamped at or after it - like --since on rows, that misses a
  removal merged in with an older stamp or never written to the journal,
  so keep the full compare. --json gives each line in the shape of
  `journal` in `moai show <id> --json`, without fields this build does not
  know. It lays the history out and holds it against nothing: an id there
  may live again - created anew, or brought back with an older stamp the
  row list misses - and only the snapshot says whether it lives now.
  A journal line it cannot read that may have held a removal - one cut
  short by a full disk or a crash - is named on stderr by file and line,
  and the exit code is not 0; with --since, only a line stamped in the
  range or with no stamp it can read. --since is the one flag it takes.

    moai show --removed --since 2026-09-29T00:00:00Z --json

  There is no query language. The filters read derived values the file does
  not hold - a group's column, an inherited epic - so run SQL on the --json
  output, where derived_status and derived_epic are worked out already:

    moai show --type issue --json |
      jq -r '.[] | .derived_epic // \"none\"' | sort | uniq -c
    moai show --archived --json | duckdb -c \"SELECT kind, count(*)
      FROM read_json('/dev/stdin', columns = {kind: 'VARCHAR'}) GROUP BY 1\"";

const STATS_HELP: &str = "  Counts the rows the filters pick - the same filters as `moai show` -
  with done, deferred, backlog items and the archive in: it counts what
  happened, so nothing finished is hidden. Every number counts one kind, issue
  unless --type names another; a group is measured through its members
  (-e, --milestone). The kind axis alone counts every row picked, to show
  what was left out. --all and --archived are taken and change nothing.
  The time filters read as in `moai show --help`.

  Nothing is stored, and the journal's column moves are never folded in.
  The numbers come from the rows and from the `model:` lines in the notes -
  the same `work` that `moai show --json` gives.

  Axes - --by status,tag prints those in full (with --bucket or --last
  the flow follows them), and without --by the overview shows the first
  three:
    status      the column, a group's read from its members as on the board
    kind        issue, epic, milestone, backlog - every row picked
    priority    0 to 3
    tag         a row counts once per tag it carries
    assignee    name and email
    epic        the epic a row stands in (derived_epic)
    milestone   the milestone it stands in, through its epic too

  Flow: per day or per week (Monday first) on your clock - the day
  `--created <day>` reads. Created counts rows made then, done counts rows
  standing in done that got there then (the time --done reads). --last is
  how many buckets, the current one included (14 days or 8 weeks).

  Lead time runs from created to done, cycle time from started_at - the
  first move out of the first column - to done, over rows standing in done,
  in minutes. A row with no start is unknown, not zero: measured and
  unknown are counted apart, and the median and p90 cover the measured
  ones only. It is wall clock, not effort.

  AI work sums the `model:` lines, and recorded counts the rows that carry
  one. Tokens add up over the lines that carry them (tokened), and tokens
  is null when none does - unknown, not 0. Reviews are the rows tagged
  review; the grade on their lines is the review grade.

  moai stats                           the overview
  moai stats -e moai-1hka              one epic's members
  moai stats --by tag,assignee         two axes in full
  moai stats --bucket day --last 30 --json

  --json gives one object. Every key is always there except three: `by`
  holds the axes asked (all seven without --by), an assignee carries email
  only when one is written, and journal_error stands only when a journal
  could not be read - then work and reviews are short. A null key means
  none - no tag, no epic, no assignee. An axis need not add up to rows: a
  row counts once per tag, and a row placed in no group (a twin's eclipsed
  line, as -e none leaves it out) stands under no epic or milestone at
  all. Durations are minutes.

  Codex and Antigravity read the same `.agents/skills/` in this repository, so
  naming either plants it for both. There is nothing to register: commit the
  directory and the team has it. --scope is Claude's registration only. The
  text is the one Claude gets; the steps that differ per agent are in the
  `moai` skill's \"Words per agent\" table. The supervisor (moai-supervise),
  its hands on tmux panes, cmux tabs and Saycode sessions (moai-tmux,
  moai-cmux, moai-saycode) and the recovery of sessions that died
  (moai-recover) are planted for Claude Code only — Codex and Antigravity get
  no supervisor.

  Optional skills are planted only where you choose them: today moai-tmux,
  moai-cmux and moai-saycode, the supervisor's hands on tmux panes, on cmux
  tabs (cmux 0.65.0 or later) and on Saycode sessions. --with <skill>
  plants one and
  --without <skill> removes it; both repeat, and a comma separates names.
  What you chose is not written down anywhere - a skill planted in the tree
  is the answer. So a plain install refreshes the optional skills already
  planted and plants no new one, and a first install plants none. Naming a
  skill that is always planted, or one name in both, is refused.

  The hooks are each agent's own: --agent codex plants `.codex/hooks.json`,
  --agent antigravity plants `.agents/hooks.json` - commit them too. Codex
  runs project hooks only once you trust them: open /hooks in a codex session
  in this repository, and again whenever they change. A hooks file moai did
  not write is left as it is - merge moai's in by hand, or move it aside. Codex
  sends hooks only for its shell, apply_patch and MCP calls.

  For Claude, skills and hooks are installed into `.claude/moai-plugin/` and
  registered with `claude`. Your settings.json is not touched - putting the
  two keys in is `claude`'s job. The one exception is the old declarations
  below.

  **Running again only overwrites.** Deleting a hook file a running session
  holds would block every tool call of that session. The one thing deleted
  is a skill directory an earlier moai planted in the same tree and this one
  no longer plants (skills/moai-work/, and skills/moai-supervise/ in
  .agents/skills/), or an optional skill left out with --without, and only
  while it holds nothing but the files moai planted there; one with a file
  of yours in it is left, and one line names it.

  The version is a hash of what is installed. Same content, same version, so
  there are no empty updates.

  The two Korean text plugins an earlier moai installed alongside
  (korean-skills and humanize-korean) are **removed**, once per scope: only
  where this repository's moai stands as an earlier version (its installed
  skill still teaches them), and only when their marketplace is the one an
  earlier moai added. Once that scope holds this version, nothing there is
  removed again. Where that earlier version stands at a scope other than
  --scope, install first brings it up to this version there (claude plugin
  update --scope <that scope>), so the next install does not remove from it
  again; if that fails, nothing is removed there and the next install tries
  again. Nothing is removed or brought up when moai's own registration
  fails. A user-scope install is left behind when another repository's moai
  stands there, and then the command to remove it is printed in one line;
  that scope is not brought up either, so it is removed once that moai is
  gone. The marketplaces are left behind. If one cannot be removed, moai's own
  registration still stands and the command to remove it by hand is printed.

  At project scope an earlier moai also declared their marketplaces in the
  committed .claude/settings.json, which kept offering them to the team. moai
  deletes those entries itself - only theirs, only when they point where an
  earlier moai pointed them, and only when nothing in that file still enables
  a plugin from them. The rest of the file stays as it was; commit the
  change. `claude plugin marketplace remove --scope project` is not used: with
  no other declaration in sight it removes the marketplace from the whole
  machine. If the entry cannot be deleted, where to delete it is printed.

    #[command(after_help = "  This repository's install is removed per scope with
  `claude plugin uninstall`, and the marketplace with
  `claude plugin marketplace remove`. Deleting the two keys from your
  settings is `claude`'s job - we do not touch someone else's JSON, except
  the old declarations below.

  **`.claude/moai-plugin/` is not deleted.** Deleting a file a running
  session holds can block that session's tool calls. Delete it after closing
  the session.

  The two Korean plugins an earlier moai installed alongside are removed **at
  the scope moai was removed from**, under the same conditions as install: an
  earlier version of moai stands there and the marketplace is the one it
  added. The marketplace is left behind - the name is global to one machine
  and another repository's install uses it. A user-scope install is also left
  behind when another repository's moai stands there, and then the command to
  remove it is printed in one line. At project scope the marketplace's
  declaration in the committed .claude/settings.json goes, as with install.

  A Claude session already open keeps calling the old hook - reopen it for
  the removal to land.

  For codex and antigravity (--agent) there is no registration to remove,
  and no file is deleted either: the `rm -r` lines for moai's skills in
  `.agents/skills/`, and the `rm` line for that agent's hooks file when moai
  wrote it, are printed, to run once no session holds them. Without that
  --agent, one line says when moai's skills are still there.

  --only <skill> removes one optional skill and nothing else: it is
  `moai skill install --without <skill>` under another name. That skill's
  directory goes (only while it holds nothing but moai's files) and the
  plugin is planted again; the registration and the other skills stay.
  A tree moai has not planted is left alone - no file and no hooks file
  is made there. Where this repository's moai is registered, that scope is
  brought up to the new version; where it is registered nowhere, only the
  files change - no registration is made. A skill that is always planted
  is refused.
