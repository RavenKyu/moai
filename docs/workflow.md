# Day-to-day workflow

How work moves through moai when several sessions — people, agents, or both —
share one repository: picking work up, planning it, doing it in a worktree,
reviewing it and getting it merged. The first part holds in any repository that
uses moai; the last section points at what this repository adds on top. Flags are
in [the CLI reference](cli.md), what to do when something ends up wrong is in
[Recovery](recovery.md), and the words this page leans on are in
[the glossary](glossary.md).

## Plant the tracker

`moai init` in a terminal shows a short screen before it writes anything: the id
prefix (it cannot change later), whether git tracks the tracker, where the agent
guide goes ([the agents page](agents.md#where-the-guide-goes)), whether to install
the hooks and skills — with a row under it for each
[optional skill](agents.md#optional-skills) — the merge driver, and whether to add
the repository to your project list. Each row comes with its default picked; Enter plants, Esc stops with
nothing written. A flag picks its row and locks it. `--yes` asks nothing and plants
the old defaults — committed, with the guide block — for choices that flags and
existing git rules or guide files have not settled. A script or an agent is never
asked, and gets the same as `--yes`; `TERM=dumb` also skips the screen.

**Whether git tracks the tracker** is the one choice that changes how everything
else behaves:

    moai init --tracking commit      shared through git (what init has always done)
    moai init --tracking exclude     kept in this clone; rules go to .git/info/exclude
    moai init --tracking gitignore   kept in this clone; rules go to .gitignore

Kept out of git, no committed file changes with `exclude` — use it to track your
own work in a repository that is not yours. There is nothing for git to merge, so
`.gitattributes` and the merge driver are left alone, and `moai status` does not
ask for them. `init` asks git which way stands every time instead of storing it,
so it will not switch it for you: moving `.moai` in or out of git is a commit you
make yourself (`git rm --cached`, or dropping the ignore line). In a linked
worktree, `exclude` and `gitignore` are refused: every worktree shares the
repository's `info/exclude`, so the rule would hide the trackers the others
commit. In a worktree of a bare repository the refusal says there is no main
checkout.

The first initialization reads existing ignore rules too, including your global
excludes. If git fails or exceeds its probe budget, `init` refuses before writing
and `status` says that the dotfile rules could not be checked. Repair git or try
again; symlink notices still appear. A tracker linked to another directory inside
the checkout is ignored at both the link and the directory it points at.

`--driver` requires commit tracking. In `init --json`, `gitignore` means that
`.gitignore` was written, and `exclude` means `.git/info/exclude` was written.
Its `driver` is `untracked` when the tracker is kept out of git — there is
nothing for a merge driver to do — and `skipped` only for `--no-driver` on a
committed tracker.

## Pick up work

1. `moai status` — start a session here. The board, the warnings and the flow come
   up on one screen, and nothing on it blocks
2. `moai ready` — what you can pick up right now, most urgent first
3. `moai mv <id> in_progress --from todo` — [pick one up](glossary.md#pick-up).
   `--from` names the [column](glossary.md#column) you saw it in, and the move
   happens only while the row still stands
   there. If another session took it first, you get one line on stderr, `stale`
   under `--json` and a non-zero exit — move on to the next row. Give one id per
   call; with several, the rows you won and the rows you lost share one exit code
4. `moai mv <id> review`, then `done` — the columns are `todo`, `in_progress`,
   `review` and `done` unless `statuses` in `.moai/config.toml` says otherwise

Work that belongs to someone else, or to nobody, stands apart under `others` in
`moai ready`. Ask its person before you [take it over](glossary.md#take-over) —
the [agents page](agents.md#the-five-rules) has the `--take` line, and why it is
the one place moai asks.

**Never move to `done` what you decided not to do.** `moai defer <id> -m '<why>'`
takes it out of the plan without changing its column or its
[kind](glossary.md#kind) — it stands [deferred](glossary.md#deferred) — and
`moai defer <id> --undo` brings the same row back. Leave a `moai note <id>` for
whoever comes next when you stop halfway — a [`Next:` note](glossary.md#next-note).

## Plan something bigger

When a request will not end inside one file, split it into one
[epic](glossary.md#epic) and three to seven issues, show the
[plan](glossary.md#plan) to the person once, and on a yes create it in one go:

    moai add --from - --dry-run      see what the plan would create
    moai add --from -                create it (the plan comes on stdin)

A plan is markdown: `# Epic title` opens an epic and `- [p1] issue title #tag`
puts an issue under it. Each issue gets an id under the epic's own,
`<epic>.<body>`, so a [member](glossary.md#member) cannot leave its epic later.

Ask the person when it is due in the same breath as the plan. A
[deadline](glossary.md#deadline) is never required, but always asked about; with no
answer, leave it empty rather than make one up. The answer goes at the end of the line
it belongs to, and `--due` covers every epic the plan creates that has no `@` of its own
— here `Recovery`, fourteen days from today, while `Storage layer` keeps its own day:

    moai add --from - --due +14 <<'PLAN'
    # Storage layer @2026-10-31
    - [p1] write atomically #bug @2026-10-20
    # Recovery
    - recover a truncated line
    PLAN

A row made alone takes the same `--due` on `moai add` or `moai backlog add`; an `@` is
read on a plan line only.

A member's deadline cannot pass its epic's, nor an epic's its milestone's — the write
is refused and names the day to give instead. As deadlines near, `moai due apply`
raises the priority of each open, not deferred issue and backlog item by the deadline
it follows — the earliest of its own and those of its milestone, epic and open parent (one day
left or less — today and past included — is `p0`, two or less `p1`, seven or less `p2`)
and notes why on the row; it never lowers one. So the day `--due` puts on an epic bounds
the work and raises its members as it nears. Nothing runs it for you — run it when `moai status` says rows lag their
deadline. The thresholds and `due_priority = "off"` live in `.moai/config.toml`.

- **Do not move an epic or a [milestone](glossary.md#milestone).** A
  [group](glossary.md#group)'s column is read from its members: pick one member
  up and the group stands `in_progress`, finish them all and it stands `done`
- **Something for later is a [backlog item](glossary.md#backlog)**, not an issue — `moai backlog add`. Backlog items stay
  off the board and out of `moai ready`, and `moai backlog promote <id> --from -`
  unfolds one into an epic and issues when its time comes. When the milestone
  it carries came from the epic the backlog item stood under, `promote` says so on
  stderr in one line
- **A [running milestone](glossary.md#running-milestone) is the person's to fill.** A milestone runs once any of
  its members has started; from then `moai ready` hands out its work plus anything
  `p0`, and nothing else is pulled into it unless the person says so

## Work in a worktree

Each piece of work goes on its own branch in a linked git
[worktree](glossary.md#worktree), so sessions do not pile commits onto one branch
and wait on each other to merge.

    git worktree add -b worktree-<epic> .worktrees/<epic> <base branch>

- **Worktrees stand in `<root>/.worktrees/`**, the place Claude Code, Codex and
  Antigravity share (moai-5s9l); `moai init` keeps it out of git. It stays inside
  the repository because Codex's trust and Antigravity's workspace go by the
  root's path. Claude Code enters one from the root (`EnterWorktree` with its
  path) — come back to the root before entering another. Worktrees made earlier
  under `.claude/worktrees/` keep working
- **Work a supervisor hands out inside a milestone branches from that
  milestone's branch**, `milestone/<milestone id>`, instead of the root branch,
  and merges back into it; the branch lives in its own worktree,
  `.worktrees/milestone-<milestone id>`, until the release takes it in
  (moai-nvju). See [handing work to workers](agents.md#hand-work-to-workers)

- **The [tracker](glossary.md#tracker) stays in the main checkout.** A `moai` run inside a linked
  worktree reads and writes the main checkout's `.moai/`, and one line on stderr
  says where the write went. Commit tracker changes from the main checkout with
  `git commit -- .moai/`; the worktree's own copy stays as it was when it split
  off, so the merge never fights over it (moai-y7go). This holds wherever the
  worktree stands — under `.worktrees/` or outside the main checkout
  (`git worktree add ../side`) — and for one split off before moai came in, with
  no `.moai` of its own; it holds for every command, `prime`, `status`, `ready`
  and `project add|ls` included. The main checkout counts as holding a tracker
  when `.moai/config.toml` is a file there — a `.moai` left with only its `lock`
  does not (moai-r0x8). `MOAI_HERE=1` turns this off for one run — almost nobody
  needs it
- **Pick up first, then make the worktree.** Every session on the clone reads the
  main checkout's tracker, so a pick-up shows to the others the moment it is
  written; commit it there so it also reaches other clones
- **See what the neighbours hold.** `moai ready --worktree` and
  `moai status --worktree` overlay what the sibling worktrees picked up. A
  worktree whose directory is named `<id>`, or on a branch `<id>` or
  `worktree-<id>`, counts as the place that work is being done, and so does the
  worktree `moai mv` was typed in when the row was picked up. `moai status` warns
  about work that was picked up with no worktree at work on it — a row picked up
  in the main checkout and carried into a worktree with some other name is one
  of them, so pick it up from inside that worktree
- **The wiki rides the branch.** Unlike `.moai/`, the wiki pages (`docs/` unless
  `wiki_dir` in `.moai/config.toml` says otherwise) are read from the worktree you
  are in and merge like any other file — write them on the branch, before the merge

## Merge the tracker file

`.moai/issues.jsonl` holds one line per issue, sorted by id, so two branches that
changed different issues collide only because their lines are neighbours. Install
the merge driver once per clone and git resolves that per issue, three-way:

    moai merge-driver --install

It records which binary git should call — the absolute path of the one that ran
it, unless the `moai` on your `PATH` is that same binary — in config that every
checkout of the clone shares. So install it from a binary that will not disappear
with a worktree, or pass `--as <path>`. If that path is gone, git falls
back to its own merge and conflict markers come back; `moai status` says so. A
clone without the driver merges exactly as plain git does.

## Name the issue in the commit

Put the id in the commit subject — `feat: draw the blocked line (<id>)`.
`moai show <id>` finds that issue's commits by the id in the subject; in the body
only `Refs:`, `Closes:` and `Fixes:` lines count. A commit that only picks up or
closes work starts with `chore(tracker):`, and the explorer's detail leaves it
out. Do not copy commit hashes into notes — a rebase makes them stale.

## Review

A review is an issue of its own, under the work it looks at:

1. `moai add 'review — <what>' -t review --parent <issue> -b '<what you look for and why>'`
2. `moai mv <review> in_progress` when the review starts, and move the work under
   review to `review`
3. `moai note <review> -b -` with the reviewer's own words — keep your own call in
   a second note, not mixed into theirs
4. `moai mv <review> done -m '<what you took in, what you handed on>'`, naming
   the id of anything handed on

The angle (`-b`) and the closing line (`-m`) are what the next reader looks for,
and for an agent the hook refuses a review without them (rule 3 on the
[agents page](agents.md#the-five-rules)). Before closing any issue, name the AI
that did the work on it — the [model line](glossary.md#model-line).

## Archive closed work

Closed work stays in `.moai/issues.jsonl` until you move it out. Every command
reads that file, so a tracker with years of finished rows gets slower and its
diffs get noisier. Moving old rows into the [archive](glossary.md#archive) is a
step you take on purpose — no ordinary write archives anything.

1. `moai status` says when there is something to move: a notice counts the closed
   rows that `moai archive` would move — rows that have stood in `done` for longer
   than `archive_days` (two weeks unless `.moai/config.toml` says otherwise)
2. `moai archive --dry-run` — see what would move. An epic moves together with its
   members, and a parent with its children, only once the whole bundle is old
   enough. Milestones never move
3. `moai archive` — move them into `.moai/archive/<year>.jsonl`, then commit
   `.moai/` like any other tracker change

Archived rows still count as context — a parent, a blocker or a milestone that
was archived is not "missing" — but the board, `moai ready` and `moai show` lists
leave them out. To find one, `moai show <id>` reads it directly and
`moai show --archived` lists the archive. Reopening one with
`moai mv <id> todo --from done` brings back only that row; the rest of its
bundle stays archived.

## In this repository

The above is moai. This repository adds its own conventions on top, written down
where its contributors read them rather than repeated here:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — the worktree recipe (the base branch is `develop`, or
  `milestone/<id>` for work inside a milestone, moai-nvju; branches
  are `worktree-moai-<id>`, and `target/` is a link to `/tmp/cargo-target/<name>`
  because `/home` stalls under parallel builds, moai-c5xo), the review grade table
  (which `/code-review` level an epic gets — `xhigh` on the review model, `max` for
  the write path and hooks, moai-9793, moai-bx6t, moai-9tqo), the roles' default
  models, the
  [`Regression-of:` line](glossary.md#regression-of) on bugs a merged epic caused
  (moai-21zt), and how a
  milestone is named before and after a release
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — building and testing, regenerating
  [the CLI reference](cli.md), and Releasing: the sections under `[Unreleased]` in
  `CHANGELOG.md` pick the next version, through `scripts/bump-version.sh`
  (moai-ug3j), after a milestone branch has taken `develop` in and gone into
  `develop` with `--no-ff` (moai-nvju). moai itself does not number versions

## When it goes wrong

- **You lost a pick-up race.** The non-zero exit and the `stale` line are the
  tool working; take the next row from `moai ready`
- **`issues.jsonl` has conflict markers.** Abort the merge, install the driver,
  and merge again — see "A conflicted `issues.jsonl`" in [Recovery](recovery.md)
- **A worktree's `.moai/` changed.** An old binary or `MOAI_HERE=1` wrote there;
  replay the change against the main checkout — see "A worktree wrote the tracker
  in the wrong place" in [Recovery](recovery.md)
- **A worktree says there is no tracker.** The main checkout holds no
  `.moai/config.toml` — see [A worktree says there is no
  tracker](recovery.md#a-worktree-says-there-is-no-tracker)
- **A command says `locked`.** Another moai is writing right now; wait and run it
  again. Deleting `.moai/lock` releases nothing
- **`moai status` names an `archive_duplicate_id`.** The same id stands live and
  in the archive — see [An archive copy conflicts with a live
  row](recovery.md#an-archive-copy-conflicts-with-a-live-row)
- **`moai status` exits non-zero with `archive_unreadable`.** An archive file is
  broken data, the same as a broken line in `issues.jsonl` — see [An archive file
  cannot be read](recovery.md#an-archive-file-cannot-be-read)
